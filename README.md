## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- JS

### What I learned
I decided grab this challenge that I can check my junior skills on HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS. I tried to use some different techniques, properties for example: template literals, conditional (ternary) operator instead if/else statement, toggle a little bit display flex/grid, how to use margin: auto on navigation manu.
This is my first code challang from Frontend Mentor.
